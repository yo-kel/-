完成服务端和客户端的连接、发送、接受



阅读c++多线程和死锁处理

```
MongoDB allows multiple clients to read and write the same data. In order to ensure consistency, it uses locking and other concurrency control measures to prevent multiple clients from modifying the same piece of data simultaneously. Together, these mechanisms guarantee that all writes to a single document occur either in full or not at all and that clients never see an inconsistent view of the data.
```

发现mongoDB自带死锁处理，数据修改是一次性完成的



服务端轮询是否有客户端请求连接，连接成功后开线程服务客户端，只有认证后才能进行其它操作，否则断开连接
